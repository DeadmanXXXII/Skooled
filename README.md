### Title: DDoS by Resource Exhaustion Using Proxies and User Agents Bypassing Rate Limits

Description: This report describes a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack targeting academia.edu, where multiple requests are generated to exhaust server resources. The attack leverages randomized URL generation, multiple proxy addresses, and varying user-agent headers to bypass rate-limiting mechanisms. By generating high-volume requests in rapid succession, the attack attempts to exhaust server resources, resulting in a denial of service for legitimate users.

Vulnerability Details:

Attack Type: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) by Resource Exhaustion

Affected Platform: Academia.edu

Script Used: Python-based script (skooed.py) that generates random URLs, bypasses rate limits, and utilizes threading for high-volume concurrent requests.


Steps of the Attack:

1. Random URL Generation: The script randomly generates URLs using a combination of pre-defined base URLs and random 7-digit numerical strings, creating a large number of unique requests.


2. Threading for Concurrency: By using threading, the script launches multiple concurrent requests (up to 50,000 threads in this instance), resulting in a massive spike in request volume.


3. Resource Exhaustion: The rapid and massive influx of requests aims to overload the server resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth) and cause slowdowns or unavailability.


4. Rate Limit Bypass: The script can be modified with proxies and varying user agents to evade rate-limiting restrictions that would otherwise prevent excessive requests from the same IP.




---

CWE IDs:

CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption - Excessive requests lead to resource exhaustion, impacting server availability.

CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling - Lack of adequate rate limiting on academia.eduâ€™s platform.

CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere - Potential exploitation of unauthenticated resources due to improper rate limiting.

CVSS Score Calculation: Based on the characteristics of this DDoS attack, the CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score would be calculated as follows:

Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)

Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)

Privileges Required (PR): None (N)

User Interaction (UI): None (N)

Scope (S): Unchanged (U)

Confidentiality (C): None (N)

Integrity (I): None (N)

Availability (A): High (H) â€“ Severe impact on availability due to resource exhaustion.


CVSS Score: 7.5 (High)

This score reflects the significant impact on availability and the low difficulty in executing this type of attack.


---

Mitigation Recommendations:

1. Rate Limiting and Throttling: Implement strict rate-limiting mechanisms based on IP addresses, user agents, and request patterns to detect and block excessive requests.


2. CAPTCHA Challenges: Enforce CAPTCHA or other challenge mechanisms for unusual access patterns to limit bot-based requests.


3. Web Application Firewall (WAF): Deploy a WAF to identify and block abnormal request patterns that indicate DDoS attempts.


4. Load Balancing and Autoscaling: Use load balancers to distribute traffic efficiently and enable autoscaling to handle sudden traffic spikes without exhausting resources.


5. Monitoring and Alerts: Continuous monitoring of server health and unusual traffic patterns can help detect early signs of resource exhaustion and trigger defensive actions.
